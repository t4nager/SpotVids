# SpotVids

This project is intended for those who want spotify to play music videos or just want some visuals when listening to music. This has only been tested on Linux


### Setup

Install VLC
```sudo snap install vlc```

Install dependencies

### Usage

It's pretty straight forward. Get an access token with "user-read-currently-playing" permissions from Spotify for your account and use it to run the application.
